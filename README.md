# 10 Days of Agents 🚀

This repository documents my **10–day challenge** to build one new AI agent every day.  
The difficulty ramps up each day — starting with simple tool-using agents, adding memory and planning,  
and ending with a capstone multi-agent system with observability and MCP integration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **LangGraph / Agno** for agent orchestration  
- **Chroma / PGVector** for long-term memory  
- **OpenTelemetry** for tracing & observability  
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for tool integration  
- Python (with FastAPI/Streamlit for UI in later days)

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn the **agentic ecosystem** hands-on  
- Explore **short-term vs long-term memory**, **planning**, and **multi-agent orchestration**  
- Practice building **scalable, observable, and modular** agent systems  
- Showcase progress with reproducible code and docs for each day  

---

## 🚦 How to Use
Each folder (`Day01` … `Day10`) is standalone.  
Inside you’ll find:
- `README.md` (overview, how to run, sample input/output)  
- `agent.py` (main implementation)  
- any supporting files (data, configs, eval harnesses)
